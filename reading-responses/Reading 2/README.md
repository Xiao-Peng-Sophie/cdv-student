**See the visualization [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-hong-kong-national-security-law-arrests/) !**

The visualization is about the impacts of Hong Kong national security law after the political protests in Hong Kong 2019. More specifically it examines the 150 people arrested because of the law as well as how the policy changes on Hong Kong’s society.In the visualization, 150 arrested people are represented through **illustrations of figures** and you can know more about their **personal stories and experiences** as you scroll down. 

The reading discusses the significance of emotions and persuasions in data visualization and communication. The author challenges the idea that data should be presented in a distant, seemingly neutral and object way. And some common techniques include minimized visuals, bar chart, or leaving the data source. However, **emotional appeal plays a significant role in this project – people are represented by illustrations instead of circles/points, and their personal stories and some quotes are included.** Therefore I think this visualization is very creative in leveraging readers’ emotions.

However, I do not think this visualization fully achieves “feminist objectivity”. Firstly, it still uses the conventional “objective” visualization graphics. Besides, **it only approaches the social issue from people who are arrested. For instance, I believe the narrative will sound very different from some Chinese mainland people living in Hong Kong**. And according to the definition of “feminist objectivity”, all people’s perspectives should be collected and represented in an inclusive way.
