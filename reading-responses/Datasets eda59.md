This is a dataset of all the tweets with the hashtag #Metaverse. I think this dataset may need some processing for visualization since it is rough text scraped from the web. Using this dataset, I want to build a project about Metaverse – what is it? What people are expecting/dreaming? But what are actually happening?

This dataset consists of a set of cosmetic products - their price, ingredients and effects on skin. I think I could combine it with some content shared on social media to investigate how cosmetic products change our perception of beauty.

This dataset collects some articles from People’s Daily News人民日报. I think it is very interesting to investigate the political use of language and how people react to it.
