## Prediction 🚨

**Social media post recommendation**

When people use social media, there are always smart recommendations of the posts based on their preferences and interests. This could be a kind of prediction for users’ potential desired contents generated by algorithms.  

**Stock market prediction** 

Machine learning and algorithms can help predict the stock market, which are used by people to optimize their investment and maximize the profits.

**Disease prediction**    

In the healthcare industry, people can get their possibility of having certain disease by comparing their own biological data to the other ones in the large dataset. 

For me, **the prediction doesn’t mean “determine”**, rather it is a sophisticated and comprehensive **observation** **of people’s past behaviors,** which **connects “past” to the seemingly unknown future**. For instance, if we actually imagine the setting of *Minority Report* being applied by big data and algorithm, the predictive policing is achieved not because the Precorgs can **determine people’s fates like a prophecy**, but because they can **monitor and analyze** people’s past to summarize patterns and insights. And I think this idea also connects to the concept of “**social physics**”, which claims that human behaviors could be observed, understood and quantified for further insights. 

For the stock market prediction, I think this prediction’s role is to help people make smart decisions and  optimize their investment plans, which is more about the accumulation of previous experience. Similarly, the disease prediction is an example of using other datasets to inform individuals. Personally I find the prediction towards **social media recommendation** particularly interesting. The reading discusses the incompatible relationship between the **“collective average”** and **“individual thought”**, in which the author argues that the prediction of big data always makes the general trend outweighs individual utterances and ignores those individual uncertainties. But on social media, I think **these two sides are somehow combined and even balanced** - on the one hand, the recommendation content is based on **our individual preferences** and interests; on the other hand, these contents are also related to what **other users (especially those are similar to us)** like to view.
