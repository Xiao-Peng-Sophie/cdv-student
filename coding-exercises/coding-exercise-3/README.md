## Exercise 3

In this exercise I learned how to visualze data using d3.js. This is a rough prototype for data zine project so I only add limited attributes of the data I've collected. 

I tried different svgs and texts. But I couldn't find a way to constrain the length of text so they look very ugly on the webpage and I decided to take them down. Also, I was thinking about how to add the mouseover effect when I'm appending the svg/texts.
