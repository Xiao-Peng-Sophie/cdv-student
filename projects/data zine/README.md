### Introduction

My data zine project is called *About Waiting*, which visualizes my waiting in past 10 days. Personally I think **waiting is a poetic behavior that carries a lot of personal memories**. **However, we always pay attention to what we are waiting for and ignore the waiting process itself**. 

What does waiting mean? According to the Oxford dictionary, waiting means “delaying action until a particular time or event”. But I believe waiting means more than that. There are so many emotions and stories behind. **When we wait for something, are we expecting something excitedly? Or are we suffering from something and hoping it ends soon? Maybe we simply enjoy the waiting itself?** 

### Inspiration & Process

This project is inspired by **[Dear Data](http://www.dear-data.com/theproject)**, which values the meaning of collecting data “by hand” from individual perspectives as a way to reflect on how data is manipulated by algorithms rather than humans. 

I use Google Sheet to collect my data – what I’m waiting for, the waiting time, location, what I’m doing and my mood. For the visualization, I use **hourglass** to represent each waiting and the time is represented by the “sand”, which is aligned with the physical rules in real world. For other aspects of data, I use different colors and shapes to elaborate the differences.  

### Further Improvement

After the presentation, I received some useful feedback. I can remove the color when explaining the differences in shapes. Also I can try different shape representations instead of using colors.
