      <p class="text2">On December 7, 1970, West German Chancellor¬†Willy Brandt fell to his knees at the Warsaw Ghetto memorial after laying a wreath, which was an unexpected and spontaneous act to deliver German‚Äôs apology for Nazi‚Äôs doing during World War II.</p>
      <div class="fixed-bg"></div>

      <p class="text3">The famous kneeling, also known as "Kniefall von Warschau",  is a historical gesture of political apologies and a worldwide symbol of Germany's reconciliation with Poland. And Willy Brandt was awarded Nobel Peace Prize for this act.</p>
    

        <p class="sentence1">Actually this is just one of those political apologies in recent years...</p>
