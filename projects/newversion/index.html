      <div class="fixed-bg"></div>

      <p class="text2">On December 7, 1970, West German Chancellor¬†Willy Brandt fell to his knees at the Warsaw Ghetto memorial after laying a wreath, which was an unexpected and spontaneous act to deliver German‚Äôs apology for Nazi‚Äôs doing during world War II.</p>
      <div class="fixed-bg"></div>

      <p class="text3">The famous kneeling, also known as "Kniefall von Warschau",  is a historical gesture of political apologies and a worldwide symbol of Germany's reconciliation with Poland. And Willy Brandt was awarded Nobel Peace Prize for this act.</p>

        <p class="sentence1"> Political apologies are quite different from personal apologies ‚Äì they entail a large group of people and even a nation‚Äôs collective memory. Apart from that, political apologies are prepared and well-rehearsed before they are delivered on formal occasions.<br><br>Political apologies have become more and more common in recent years. On the one hand, a nation uses political apologies to admit wrongdoings, express regrets and ask for forgiveness. On the other hand, political apologies serve as an essential diplomatic strategy to resolve tensions between countries and to achieve future collaborations.
